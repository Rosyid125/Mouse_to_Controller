## To Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Install the latest version of vJoy from: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/). Also... make sure that vjoy is running.
3. Install dependencies by running: `pip install pyautogui pynput pyvjoy`
4. Run the script using: `python mouseToJoy.py`

# What is this?
Uhhh... this is a script that turns your mouse into a controller! It detects:

1. X and Y axis movements when you move the mouse
2. Left-clicks
3. Right-clicks
4. Wheel scrolling (P.S. It might lag if you scroll too fast—still working on fixing that, hehe)

# What else?
Umm... yeah, I almost forgor—there’s a *venv* folder included. You can delete it if you want. But what is it, you ask? More on that here: [https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (I’m not explaining it, hehe—it just keeps my global Python environment clean without unnecessary libraries).

That’s it, baby! Shout out to my friends:
